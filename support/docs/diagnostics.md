# FHIR JSON Data (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/fhir-<pat_mrn_id>-<encounter_id>.json)

These generated FHIR JSON files follow the pattern
`fhir-<pat_mrn_id>-<encounter_id>.json` and contains FHIR (Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources) data in JSON format. It typically includes a bundle
of FHIR resources such as Consent, Patient, Organization, Encounter, and
Observation.

## Fields

- `resourceType`: The type of FHIR resource, in this case, a Bundle.
- `id`: The unique identifier for the bundle.
- `type`: The type of bundle, typically "transaction" for FHIR transactions.
- `meta`: Metadata about the bundle, including the last updated timestamp.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp when the bundle was created.
- `entry`: An array of entries, each representing a FHIR resource included in
  the bundle. Common resources include:
  - `Consent`: Represents a patient's consent for treatment.
  - `Patient`: Contains demographic information about the patient.
  - `Organization`: Represents the healthcare organization.
  - `Encounter`: Represents a healthcare encounter.
  - `Observation`: Represents observations or assessments made about the
    patient.

Each entry in the bundle contains the following fields:

- `fullUrl`: The full URL of the entry.
- `resource`: The FHIR resource object, which varies depending on the type of
  resource (e.g., Patient, Organization, Observation).

Each resource object contains fields specific to its resource type. For example,
a Patient resource may include fields such as `name`, `gender`, `birthDate`, and
`address`.

# FHIR Result JSON Data (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/fhir-result-fhir-<pat_mrn_id>-<encounter_id>.json)

The FHIR JSON file follows the pattern
`fhir-result-fhir-<pat_mrn_id>-<encounter_id>.json`. This file contains the
response from the FHIR publishing endpoint for each of the corresponding
`fhir-<pat_mrn_id>-<encounter_id>.json`. This can be used to verify the success
or failure of FHIR transactions.

# FHIR HTTP File (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/fhir.http)

The `fhir.http` file contains HTTP request data related to FHIR transactions
that occurred during the diagnostics session. This file is useful for debugging
and analyzing the interactions with FHIR servers, especially in the development
sandbox.

## Contents

The file typically contains a series of HTTP requests and responses, including:

- `HTTP request headers and body`, showing the details of the FHIR request sent
  to the server.
- `HTTP response headers and body`, showing the response received from the FHIR
  server, including any FHIR resources or error messages.

# SQLite Database (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/resource.sqlite.db)

The `resource.sqlite.db` file is a SQLite database that contains the content and
admin tables. It is used to store and manage data processed during the
diagnostics session.

## Tables

The database contains various tables, each serving a specific purpose in the
context of the diagnostics package. Common tables include:

- `Admin Tables`: These tables contain information related to the diagnostics
  session, validation of the data processed during the session. They include
  details about any issues or errors encountered and their respective
  remediation steps.
- `Content Tables`: These tables store individual and aggregated data derived
  from the raw data ingested during the diagnostics session. They provide a
  consolidated view of the data for further analysis and processing.

# Diagnostics .md (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/diagnostics.md)

The `diagnostics.md` file is a Markdown file that contains detailed information
about the diagnostics session. It includes various sections that outline the
steps and actions taken during the session, as well as any issues or errors
encountered. This file can be used to review and understand the steps taken
during a diagnostics session, as well as to troubleshoot any issues that may
have arisen.

## Contents

- `workflowPaths`: Paths used during the diagnostics session for ingressing,
  processing, and egressing data.
- `walkRootPaths`: Paths that were walked during the session to collect data.

  including STDOUT and status.

# Diagnostics .json (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/diagnostics.json)

The `diagnostics.json` file contains detailed information about the diagnostics
session in JSON format. It includes data about the workflow paths, sources
processed, and diagnostics details for each step of the session.

## Fields

  session.
  - `workflowPaths`: Paths used for ingressing, processing, and egressing data.
  - `walkRootPaths`: Paths that were walked during the session to collect data.
  - `referenceDataHome`: The path to the directory containing reference data.
  - `sources`: A list of source files processed during the session, including

  specific step in the session.
  - `insertable`: An object containing details about the execution of a step,
    such as the identity, code, SQL statements, session ID, and any narrative or

# .consumed folder (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/.consumed)

This folder contains all the files that were put into the /ingress folders and
were successfully ingested. There could be a single or multiple sets of .csv
data files.

# .workflow folder (/egress/<SESSION_ID>/.workflow)
